# Intorduction: 
Mexico City's metro is one of the largest in the world, the system served 1.655 billion passengers in 2019. With such high ridership, the businesses surrounding each of the system's stations stand to benefit from the high traffic of passangers. However, establishing a business in such a high traffic area will require a higher capital investment than usual. Therefore, it is key for the succes of establishing a business around a station to idenitfy posssible competitors or lack thereof. The aim of this project is to do just that,explore venues around each station in Mexico City's system to identify possible opportunities for a retail store. 


# Data:
The data to be used in this project include a list of Mexico City's metro stations, which will be scraped from Wikipedia. Furthermore, Foursquare's API will be employed to explore venues around each station and learn more about each specific area surrounding each station.
